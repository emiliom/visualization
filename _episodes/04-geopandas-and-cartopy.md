The moment you've likely been waiting for: plotting *your* data on a map using cartopy. Most of this episode will be live-coding. Fundamentals and broadly-defined steps are below.

## Plotting Your Own <small>(vector)</small> Data

### 1. Load It.

It's likely that your geospatial information will be loaded into Python using a library like Geopandas or similar. The only requirement that cartopy has for plotting spatial (vector) data is that it's loaded into a Shapely geometry class (e.g. `shapely.geometry.Polygon` or `shapely.geometry.Point` --- these were covered in the Vector tutorial, so we won't go into detail here).

For this example we'll be using a shapefile of lakes on Washington's Olympic Peninsula from the [National Hydrography Dataset](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography) <small>(sourced from the NHD_Waterbody data)</small>.

    lakes = geopandas.read_file("oly-lakes.shp")


>## CRS
> It's important that you know the coordinate reference system (CRS) that your data is projected in. Many times, data loaded from shapefiles (or other vector formats) have their CRS embedded; loading these data using geopandas will make the CRS available in the `.crs` attribute of the `GeoDataFrame` (e.g. `data.crs`). Geopandas expresses CRSs as EPSG codes.

### 2. Decide on Map Projection + Create Axes

As in the previous episode we need to establish **the projection of our map**. This is *irrespective* of the coordinate reference system of the data; this is part of the beauty of cartopy: data and visualization are separate, and cartopy handles the necessary cartographic conversion.

For our example we'll use the Lambert Conformal projection:

    ax = plt.axes(projection = ccrs.LambertConformal()))

>## Under The Hood
> What's happening here, really? When you add the `projection` keyword argument to the generic `plt.axes` function, you're instructing `matplotlib` (via `cartopy`) to, instead of creating a regular `AxesSubplot` object to plot data on, create a `GeoAxesSubplot` object. This special set of axes is *projection-aware*, and is responsible for the necessary transformation of data from source projection to the specified axes projection.

### 3. Plot Data

This is the interesting part. Here the steps are varied depending on *what kind of data* is being plotted. Cartopy contains several helper functions for plotting different kinds of data, and they all are *attributes* of the `GeoAxes` object. Each of the "adder" functions begins with `add_`. <small>(<a href="https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/v0.13/matplotlib/geoaxes.html">functions reference</a>)</small>

Since we're working with vector data here, we'll be using `ax.add_geometries`. This function takes two arguments: an *iterable* (list, iterator, etc.) of Shapely geometries, and the coordinate reference system of these data. Conveniently, geopandas gives us an interable of geometries directly, via the `geometry` column of any `GeoDataFrame`.

For our example, we can therefore write:

    ax.add_geometries(lakes.geometry, crs = ccrs.PlateCarree()) # for Lat/Lon data.

We also want to make sure we can actually see the data. To do this, we can set the extent of the map from the boundaries of the whole GeoDataFrame using `total_bounds`.

    bounds = lakes.total_bounds
    ax.set_extent([bounds[0], bounds[2], bounds[1], bounds[3]])

All together the code looks like this:

    bounds = lakes.total_bounds
    ax = plt.axes(projection = ccrs.LambertConformal())
    ax.set_extent([bounds[0], bounds[2], bounds[1], bounds[3]])
    ax.add_geometries(lakes.geometry, crs=ccrs.PlateCarree())

### 4. Add Context

For example, perhaps we'd like to add the peak of Mt. Olympus (10N 447087.3 5294290.9) to our map:

    ax.scatter(447087.3, 5294290.9, transform = ccrs.UTM(10), color='red')
    ax.text(447087.3 + 2000, 5294290.9, "Mt. Olympus", transform = ccrs.UTM(10), color='red')


**Important Point**: Anything that Matplotlib can do (*for the most part*) can be plotted on cartopy `GeoAxes`. Most matplotlib plotting functions (`text`, `contourf`, etc), require *either* a `crs` argument or a `transform` argument describing the **source projection** of the data. Notice how above we gave the coordinates of Mt. Olympus in UTM 10T; cartopy does the conversion to our projected space for us.

Or, maybe we'd like to add some other borders. This is where the built-in features of Cartopy can help us. We can use `cartopy.feature.NaturalEarthFeature` to download useful features from the [Natural Earth](http://naturalearthdata.com) dataset.

    land = cf.NaturalEarthFeature(
        category='physical',
        name='land',
        scale='10m',
        facecolor=cf.COLORS['land'],
        alpha=0.5)

This downloads the land dataset at 10m scale (from the physical collection in Natural Earth), colors the polygons using a standard "land" color, and sets the opacity to 0.5. The options for `category`, `name`, and `scale` are often difficult to decipher. If you travel to the Natural Earth dataset of your choice (e.g. 50m-scale countries: https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/50m-cultural-vectors/50m-admin-0-countries-2/) and use your browser to copy the link within the "Download Countries" button (https://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/50m/cultural/ne_50m_admin_0_countries.zip), you can usually find what you're looking for. In this case: `category = cultural`, `name = admin_0_countries`, and `scale = 50m`.

To add the above `land` to the map, all we need to do is the following:

    ax.add_feature(land)

Here's the full code:

    bounds= park.total_bounds
    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))
    ax = plt.axes(projection = ccrs.LambertConformal())
    ax.set_extent([bounds[0], bounds[2], bounds[1], bounds[3]])
    ax.gridlines()

    ax.add_geometries(park.geometry, crs=ccrs.PlateCarree(), facecolor='none', edgecolor='k')

    land = cf.NaturalEarthFeature(
        category='physical',
        name='land',
        scale='10m',
        facecolor=cf.COLORS['land'],
        alpha=0.5)
    ax.add_feature(land)

    ax.scatter(447087.3, 5294290.9, transform = ccrs.UTM(10), color='red')
    ax.text(447087.3 + 2000, 5294290.9, "Mt. Olympus", transform = ccrs.UTM(10), color='red')

Matplotlib and cartopy represent a robust pairing of data visualization tools for creating impressive, customizable static maps. Next we'll move onto a quick tutorial to create moveable, interactive maps with your own data.
